Bash
====
There are several choices of bash profiles that have appealed to me so far; partly
because the prompts are pretty, but also because I appreciate the information provided.

- [Sexy Bash Prompt](https://github.com/twolfson/sexy-bash-prompt)

- [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline)
	- NOTE: This is actually a vim plugin (which is also super helpful),
	but to install for shell prompts, look [here](http://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage/shell-prompts.html).

- [Powerline Shell](https://github.com/banga/powerline-shell)
	- This is a lighter weight version of the actual Powerline prompt, and doesn't
	include the actual vim plugin

Once installed, customize to heart's content (such as adding the current time to the prompt or other formatting). A customized bash profile that I have is also available; it's basically a mix of Sexy Bash Prompt and the default profile provided by Cygwin.
