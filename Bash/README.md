Bash
====
There are several choices of bash prompts that have appealed to me so far; partly
because they're pretty, but also because I appreciate the information provided.

- [Sexy Bash Prompt](https://github.com/twolfson/sexy-bash-prompt)

- [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline)
	- NOTE: This is actually a vim plugin (which is also super helpful),
	but to install for shell prompts, look [here](http://powerline.readthedocs.io/en/master/usage/shell-prompts.html).

- [Powerline Shell](https://github.com/banga/powerline-shell)
	- This is a lighter weight version of the actual Powerline prompt, and doesn't
	include the actual vim plugin

Once installed, customize to heart's content (such as adding the current time or other formatting).
