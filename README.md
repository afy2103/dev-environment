## README

This is a repository containing instructions and files for setting up my dev environment; each subdirectory contains the information and/or files for a specific framework or program, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Sublime Text 3. 

This obviously isn't an exhaustive list for everything involved in a dev environment; it just mostly covers frameworks/tools/scripts that either have a nontrivial set of instructions (as they might come with a number of issues, like setting up React Native for example) or allow for a degree of customization that I've already set for myself (such as Sublime packages or bash profiles). Thus, it won't cover things that are both necessary and easy to install, such as a VCS or languages, unless they're prerequisites for the things listed here (though more obvious ones like having Python installed are probably going to be assumed).

### Other helpful tools
The list below don't really require any customization/custom files or complicated instructions, but are just additional easy-to-install tools that certainly do help with development.

- [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
	- Data science platform powered by Python
	- Manages packages, dependencies, and environments
	- Helpful replacement for pip when installing packages that have C++ and other languages

- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
	- API development/test platform
	- Allows for quick construction and testing of API requests, as well as building of workflows and integration testing suites
	- Integrates with build systems
