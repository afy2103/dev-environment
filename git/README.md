# git

- Sets [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) as the default editor
- Uses [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) for all `git diff` output
- Uses [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) as the filesystem monitor hook to tell git what files changed
- Don't use a pager for `git branch`
